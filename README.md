# Personal summer project
I was bored one summer and took the free online [fullstackopen.com](https://fullstackopen.com/) course to improve my skills in some areas that I felt I were lacking in.

# [Full Stack Open 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

It serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST as well as GraphQL APIs built with Node.js.

Other topics that this course covers is testing, configuration & environment management, TypeScript, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data. This repository contains my solutions for some of this course's exercises that I found extra interesting.

Keywords: React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, REST, GraphQL, TypeScript
